# Deleted Several Social Site Accounts


Hello World!

Due to several reasons, I forced myself to delete several social site accounts of mine, which include:

1. **Matrix/Element:** `@raselm:matrix.org`
2. **Keybase:** [https://keybase.io/raselm](https://keybase.io/raselm)
3. **Stack Overflow (new account):** [https://stackoverflow.com/users/22455902/raselmandol](https://stackoverflow.com/users/22455902/raselmandol)
4. **Reddit (new account):** [https://www.reddit.com/user/raselmandol](https://www.reddit.com/user/raselmandol)

Earlier this year, around the middle of February, I signed a message through my PGP key that stated something like:

> "It is unsure whether I will be back on these sites or not."

Since then, I have not recreated accounts on those social sites. However, I do wish to create new accounts soon.  
Currently, I am active on **LinkedIn** and **Bluesky**, and I check my emails very frequently.  
If you wish to reach me, **email** and **LinkedIn** are the best ways.

## Important:

- I have **NOT** changed my PGP keys.  
  My current public PGP key is:

If anything changes, or if I have any new updates regarding all of this,  
**I will sign those posts/messages with my PGP key and announce them** either on:

- [My GitHub](https://github.com/raselmandol)
- or [My personal website](https://raselm.me)
