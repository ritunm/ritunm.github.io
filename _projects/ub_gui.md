I am delighted to present UB GUI, a desktop application(made with C#(.NET)) that I made to give Windows a look of Ubuntu. I made this application in my free time (can call in my ToTo Lab). Created with unwavering dedication during precious moments of free time, UB GUI is a tribute to the unconditional love and unwavering support of two incredible individuals: My Parents. When I will get free time again, i will make a better version of this one. Hope you all will enjoy this one.


### Features

When this application is opened, it will be in Maximized mode, occupying the entire screen. To access other minimized applications, a button has been included to restore them, while the application itself will remain in full-screen mode. Only the taskbar will be visible, unhidden.
