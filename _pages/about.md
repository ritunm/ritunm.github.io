subtitle: An explorer, trying to find myself. I love to explore and learn unknown things. I mostly spend my time doing research related to Machine Learning/Deep Learning, Machine Learning on Resource-Constrained Devices, Cyber Security, Ethical Hacking, Software Development for all the topics mentioned above, and Human Neuron-related real-time research.

I am actively involved in deep learning projects, focusing on integrating machine learning models with software applications. Currently, I'm working under the supervision of [Dr. Diptendu Sinha Roy](https://nitm.ac.in/department/computer-science-engineering/faculty-1/prof-diptendu-sinha-roy), Professor, [NIT Meghalaya](https://nitm.ac.in/), on topics such as the development of edge computing on resource-constrained devices, IoT-based 6G-enabled vehicular network development, machine learning on resource-constrained devices (i.e., medical image processing, classification of diseases through MRIs, medical image segmentation, etc.), and software reliability.

I am also currently involved in cyber security research under the supervision of [Dr. Surmila Thokchom](https://nitm.ac.in/department/computer-science-engineering/faculty-1/dr-surmila-thokchom), Assistant Professor, [NIT Meghalaya](https://nitm.ac.in/), on topics including IoT-based authentication systems, malware detection and classification using machine learning, IoT-based ethical hacking tools development (combining LoRa security), and secure system development for distributed cloud computing.
