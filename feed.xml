From a cell to graveyard, the journey is very interesting. If we think how we thought when we were 2 years old, we will be lost in thinking; still, we will probably not find the actual representation of that time - how we thought, when asking for something, even when we didn’t learn to speak. Science has made so many things possible, till now. From understanding human brain signals to talking with AI (will talk about this someday), whatever we see beside us these days became possible, which has been contributed by science and a lot of people who were involved with this process since the beginning - from making humans social to dealing with machines today.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/auf_Helgoland-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/auf_Helgoland-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/auf_Helgoland-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/auf_Helgoland%0A%20%20%20%20%20%20%20%20.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> A colony of Northern gannet.

(Wikipedia) </div> <hr/> <h2 id="human-understanding">Human Understanding</h2> <p>If we look further, deeper into the structure of human DNA, we will find something interesting - from the sequencing of patterns to RNA and mRNA. Everything is very interesting. I think, <strong>“the human will never understand each other, not even 1%”</strong>. It’s so complex that, even if you get confirmation that you understood a person for a time period - let’s say 10 seconds - there is a near 100% possibility that it is not true.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Snapshot-of-DNA-in-motion-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Snapshot-of-DNA-in-motion-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Snapshot-of-DNA-in-motion-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Snapshot-of-DNA-in-motion.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> DNA in motion (Photo from: Accelerating the Research in Drug Delivery System; A Challenge of the Earth Simulator to Medical Innovation) </div> <hr/> <h2 id="personal-example">Personal Example</h2> <p>What do we want? What does our heart want? Let’s take an example. I liked technology since the very beginning of my educational life, most probably when I was in grade/class 2. I never liked biology, but I had to study biology from class 9 to 12 (high school). When I was in my first year of undergrad, in mind something happened - what I say in my language is, <strong>“Brain Signal Death”</strong>, which ultimately continued till 3rd semester. And then the process was stopped and my brain towards biology developed a gradient polishing of unknown signals (I will try to explain this in another post), which I can’t actually say is love, but is something similar to getting attracted in a spiritual way (this is something I want to discuss/write someday), but the absence of caring is vital here - neither positive nor negative - something but not 0. It holds a value which is ready to be formed but not now, almost there but hasn’t reached.</p> <hr/> <h2 id="parallel-universes">Parallel Universes</h2> <p>Now, think about an exact same cloned version of Rasel, but the only difference is, he liked Biology. But point to be noted here - neither I nor the Rasel 2 did anything related to Biology; it just sat idle inside - the hate and like both.</p> <div class="row mt-3"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" srcset="/assets/img/Cosmos-animation_Friedmann-closed-480.webp 480w,/assets/img/Cosmos-animation_Friedmann-closed-800.webp 800w,/assets/img/Cosmos-animation_Friedmann-closed-1400.webp 1400w," type="image/webp" sizes="95vw"/> <img src="/assets/img/Cosmos-animation_Friedmann-closed.gif" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="100%" height="auto" loading="eager" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"/> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Cosmos animation of a cyclic universe.
